> "We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect."  
> — *Anaïs Nin*  
  
All of ancient history and knowledge has been passed down through texts, from Hammurabi's Code carved in stone during Babylonian times, to poems transcribed on paper during the Han Dynasty, to the scientific breakthroughs we type on the computers today.  
  
Writing does more than preserve records. Unlike spoken tales, it can be edited and revised, allowing thoughts to flow more coherently and messages to transmit more efficiently. It's why we can read significantly faster than we can listen.  
  
So why am I writing a blog? What knowledge could I possibly impart?  
Honestly? Not much. In the age of AI, I can't possibly compete with million-dollar models built by some of the most talented mathematicians and computer scientists, trained on the world's largest library, the internet. But I have something they don’t, human experiences. The kind of fleeting moments that are common to you and me, experiences that are becoming increasingly rare as we spend more time homebound and online.  
  
Well, I say "you," but realistically, future me will probably be the only person reading these posts. I don't intend to reach a wide audience, there are far more valuable ways to invest your time. Even clipping your nails would be more productive than reading these random scattered thoughts.  
  
My goals for this blog are simple, to quantify my thoughts, improve my writing skills (something I desperately need with my computer science background), and most importantly, to maintain a record of my experiences living on this Earth. Though maybe that's a lie. Maybe this is all just practice for the 75-page thesis I'll eventually have to write.  
  
The contents of this blog will likely be exactly what I've warned you about, random scattered thoughts. Currently, I have a few themes in mind:  
Movie and book reviews, philosophical analysis, occasional statistical/computer science/machine learning studies, personal experiences, and whatever other nonsense that seems worthwhile.  
  
As I've said, I'm trying to bring back old-school blogging for myself. All contents in every post will be researched, written, and revised by me and good ol’ Google. So expect mistakes, but I can promise you this at least, it won’t be AI slop you’re reading, it will be human slop, a human fumbling toward clarity.
