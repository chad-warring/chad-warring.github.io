## About Me

Hi, I’m **Chad Warring** 👋  
I’m currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science at one of Europe’s universities.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy:  
- 📚 Reading  
- 🏋️ Gym  
- 🏞️ Hiking  
- ♟️ Chess  
- 🎥 Cinema  

I wanted to navigate and reflect on the mess my life is via an old school blog.
