As a computer science student, I have World War II to thank for accelerating the invention of the computer. Under the pressure of survival, some of history’s most important inventions emerged, computers, radar and rocketry. Survival didn't just breed invention, it demanded it.  
  
But what about the opposite scenario? Consider Magnus Carlsen, arguably the greatest chess player. He's undeniably a big fish, but in what pond? The World Chess Championship is as big as it gets, and yet every year from 2013 to 2023 he inched to a higher Elo, competing mostly against himself. When you're that dominant, the pressure doesn't come from those around you, it comes from within. In 2022, he proved this during an interview, "I'm not motivated to play another match... I don't have any inclination to play." Even greatness, it seems, needs resistance to stay sharp.  
  
After I graduated, I received an offer from an American tech company for a software engineering position. From where I came from, this was a dream come true. It was too good to pass up, the kind of opportunity you're supposed to jump at without hesitation, and that's what I did. But a few months later, I received an offer from one of the most prestigious universities in the world to study Master's in Data Science. I had a choice to make: stay in my home country where I knew the landscape and lived comfortably, or fly to the other side of the world and work my way up from the bottom again while living the student life and competing against some of the most talented people in the world.  
  
I chose the pond where I'd be smaller.  
  
There's something about competition that reshapes you. At my previous university, I could thrive without much resistance. But at this new place, my mission shifted from thriving to surviving. A lot of students I've met had stellar track records, attended MIT, Oxford or Ivy League level schools, interned at companies like FAANG or OpenAI. It's a jarring pivot, suddenly realising you're no longer ahead but barely keeping pace with the slowest runner. And honestly? It's uncomfortable and scary. But it's also a muscle I'd let atrophy, the ability to endure and adapt when things don't come easily.  
  
We tend to think comfort is the goal, but maybe discomfort is where you feel the most alive. Humans have survived thousands of years of torment, whether self-inflicted like the World War eras or handed down by nature like the Black Plague. We survived, we rebuilt, we thrived. Not because survival was comfortable, but because it forced us to evolve. The desperation for survival is a remarkable thing. Aron Ralston survived 127 hours trapped in a canyon and cut off his own arm to save himself. Learning the prerequisites and mathematical foundations became my version of that survival instinct.  
  
My previous university emphasised the practical side, often focusing on how to apply algorithms and machine learning techniques to problems. In fact, for a computer science degree, linear algebra wasn't even a required course. The current university, however, emphasises learning concepts from first principles, and you need a deep understanding to do so. Through my desperation, I learned Calc I, Calc II, Introduction to Statistics, Probability Theory, and Linear Algebra in a few months while working a full-time job through MIT OCW. Now this might seem standard to some, but for me, this was a sheer cliff.  
  
So which is better, being a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?  
  
Being a big fish gives you confidence. It lets you experiment with a safety net. You can develop your style and build momentum. There's value in that. Some people stay big fish their entire lives and do meaningful work. They become experts in niche fields, leaders in small communities, or the go-to person for specific problems.  
  
But staying too long in that comfortable pond can make you fragile. It might push you into lethargy. You stop questioning yourself. You plateau.  
  
Being a small fish forces humility. You're surrounded by people who are faster, smarter, more experienced. It's humbling, sometimes painfully so. But it also recalibrates your sense of what's possible. You see someone solve a problem in three lines of code that would've taken you thirty. You realise your "best" was just someone else's baseline.  
  
The real trick isn't choosing one or the other. It's knowing when to switch ponds.  
  
I think about this every time I'm proving a theorem at 1 AM while eating chicken and pasta. You bet I'm thinking about the comfortable office, high salary, eating out, all the things I voluntarily passed up on. Some days I miss being the big fish, the easy wins and the confidence that came with them. But most days, I'm grateful for the struggle.  
  
Here's what I didn't expect though, being a small fish doesn't mean you stay small forever. After a few months of struggling, something shifted. The problems that once seemed impossible became merely difficult. The concepts that required three readings now clicked on the second pass. I'm not drowning anymore. I'm swimming, sometimes even keeping up.  
  
And that's when I realised the real value of the big pond. It's not about becoming the biggest fish. It's about discovering that the ocean you thought was impossibly vast is actually navigable. The people you thought were geniuses are just people who've been swimming longer and in the right direction.  
  
Maybe that's what Magnus Carlsen lost. When you're so far ahead that no one can challenge you, you lose the reference point that tells you you're still moving forward. You need other fish in the pond, not to beat them necessarily, but to remind you why you're swimming in the first place.  
  
So which pond should you choose? I'd say this, if you're early in your journey, be a big fish for a while. Build your confidence, develop your foundation, learn what you're capable of when things go right. But don't get too comfortable. When you start to feel like you're coasting, when the challenges stop challenging, when you catch yourself thinking you've figured it all out, that's your signal. It's time to find a bigger pond.  
  
After all, stagnant water breeds nothing but algae. Even great white sharks need to keep swimming to stay alive. The question isn't which pond you're in, it's whether you're still moving.
